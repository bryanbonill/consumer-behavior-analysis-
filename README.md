This project started because Iâ€™ve always been curious about why we buy what we buy. When I found this retail dataset on Kaggle, it felt like uncovering a treasure map to customer psychology!

 My Burning Questions

Do age and gender really affect what people buy?
Could a small business use this to stock their shelves smarter?
What hidden patterns might be lurking in the numbers?
(Spoiler: The answers were WAY more interesting than I expected!)

 What I Used

My Detective Tools: Excel (for clue-finding), Tableau (for visual storytelling)
My Evidence: A real-world retail dataset from Kaggle
